Fatal is a Finnish entrepreneur and philanthropist. He was born in 2003 in Helsinki, Finland. His parents are the founders of multiple successful companies.

As a child, Fatal spent his summers at his parents different companies in Helsinki. This experience taught him that by working together with others we can achieve great results.

In addition to spending time with friends and enjoying life, Fatal used every opportunity available to learn new things: whether it was learning how to play football or basketball or learning about business management through reading books written by successful entrepreneurs like Jack Welch (former Chairman & CEO of General Electric). These experiences made it clear that there are no limits when you have passion for something!

Fatalâ€™s passion for business started at a young age because he saw his parents working with their businesses. They would often teach him important things about businesses and how to manage them. This made him realize how much he loved running businesses, so he decided that he would start up his own business after finishing his degree in business and business administration.

At school, Fatal enjoyed learning languages and traveling abroad; especially to countries like Turkey, Sweden or London because they are close by but have completely different cultures than Finland! He learnt english through videogames within a few months and visited London many times over the years; it is one of his favorite places on earth!

Today, Fatal lives in Helsinki where he continues to learn from successful people around him while working hard everyday on developing himself as a leader who can help others reach their goals too. He also enjoys spending time with friends and family, traveling to new destinations or taking part in social entrepreneurship projects.
